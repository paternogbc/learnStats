This interactive application allows you to explore how the 
partition of [Sums of Squares](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sum_of_squares) are calculated in simple linear regressions. Change one of the parameters to see what happens.

The source code for this application is available [here](https://github.com/paternogbc/learnStats/tree/master/apps/SSQ). Want to help?
fork this [repo](https://github.com/paternogbc/learnStats/tree/master/apps/SSQ) and create a pull request. Please, report bugs [here](https://github.com/paternogbc/learnStats/issues).
